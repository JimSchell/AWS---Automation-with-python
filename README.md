# AWS---Automation-with-python
Using python to automate services on AWS

Overview

The idea of this project is to set up automation so when an EC2 is created it kicks off automation that takes information from server, processes and tags the EC2 with the name of who created. To do this I will be using the following AWS service.

 Run an empty log as it creates a log group which will be needed.

Now we need to create an eventbridge rule, we will need a cloudtrail in place as we ill be using the cloudtrail api

I then set up an eventbridge scheduler with Lambda and this is invoked asynchronously â€“ eventbridge is a serverless service and connects application components together using events, eventbridge also has the capability to automatically ingest events from over 200 AWS services and third party SaaS partners.

I then needed to create a target when the rule is hit, in this case the lambda function created earlier.

When I go back into lambda on the console you can see the trigger is set

Using boto3 documentation I imported the stop/start code for an ec2

Next I created an EC2 instance I kept it as amazon linux and used t2 micro as it came under the free tier
We can see that the cloudwatch log on the lambda function is working highlighted by the log at 20:18

I then selected the below and went to a JSON format editor

Had to create permissions on IAM to allow the EC2 instance to tag, which can be seen below
